# Calculator-GUI-Tkinter
An awesome calculator developed with Tkinter.

I've taken 2 days from my 10-day programming challenges, but I've continued reading up on the Tkinter Docs. 
I took a chance building my first GUI with Tkinter called Parsed, a computer science dictionary, and quickly realized I needed to improve.

So, here's another go with a calculator developed using Tkinter!
